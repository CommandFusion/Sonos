# Sonos Module for CommandFusion iViewer

This module allows you to integrate [Sonos](http://www.sonos.com) control, complete with auto-discovery, right into your [CommandFusion iViewer](http://www.commandfusion.com/iviewer.html) projects.  
It is a WIP (Work In Progress), so please contribute and test. Use the [issues tab right here in GitHub](Sonos/issues) to report and discuss specific issues.  
Use the [CommandFusion Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/commandfusion/) for more generic discussion.

## Folder Structure

* `Current` - This is the folder where the latest version of the module can be found. It uses the GUI from the JRiver module, and still needs to be separated and cleaned up.
* `z_JB WIP (OLD)` - As the folder name suggests, old code, but may be of use to someone.
* `z_CodeWithoutGUI (OLD)` - As the folder name suggests, old code without a GUI (removed due to copyright and licensing concerns), but may be of use to someone.
